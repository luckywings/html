It co-starred Trisha and Prakash Raj with Vijay as the lead.[38] Ghilli was the first Tamil film of all time to gross over ₹500 million, or ₹50 crore, in the domestic box office.[39] The film grossed nearly $500,000 in the Malaysian market.[40] Ghilli also broke the record for the most people seeing a movie in the first week of its release, previously held by M. G. Ramachandran's Adimai Penn (1969).[40] Ghilli received favourable reviews.[41] The Hindu stated that "Vijay, the hero whom the masses today identify with, and Prakash Raj, the inimitable villain in tow, this flick, "Ghilli"...on a winning track".[42]
